An open source mod for Minecraft Forge to auto-heal world after an explosion inspired by the famous bukkit pluggin [CreeperHeal](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/creeperheal-nitnelave/) from [Nitnelave](https://github.com/nitnelave).

## Note: 
A while ago I forked this mod when it was version 1.2.0 in order to keep it update, so I called it version 1.3.0
[Unofficial port](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/unofficial-forge-creeper-heal)  

The official mod sometimes gets updates, but it has hugely digressed with a completely remade engine, and it is called 2.0.0.  It seems better in many ways, so check it out!
